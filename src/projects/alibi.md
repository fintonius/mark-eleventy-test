      ALIBI is simultaneously a fictional party and a process for speculatively
      designing for our future. Combining elements of nordic live action
      roleplay and longform improv as a form of collaborative
      social-publishing, the experience is 'imprinted' on to the
      participants through the combination of a 360° contextual illusion
      and their inter- character engagement. On the one hand, ALIBI affords
      participants the opportunity to explore the underlying social
      contract of 'partying', by sidestepping themselves and experiencing
      it through the prism of another, fictional identity. On the other
      hand, ALIBI engages participants in a design fiction process where
      they collaboratively construct a scenario five years in the future,
      collectively negotiating how the world has changed in the areas of
      science and technology, culture and the environment, before
      establising a “party” narrative within that framework and then
      roleplaying that as a lived reality. Armed with this alibi,
      participants are invited to delve into the fiction and find moments
      that are memorable and meaningful. 

      ALIBI is a scalable event, ranging from 3-10 hrs and 5-50 participants. 

      ALIBI is regularly delivered by a multidisciplinary team of artists.
      Previous contributors have included: Artists Mark Durkan, Eilis
      McDonald, Aine McBride, Cillian Finnerty, artist and musician
      Michelle Doyle, filmmaker Stewart Lambert, theatremaker Jamie Harper,
      writer John Holten and archaeologist and game- designer Ivan Pawle.

      ALIBI posters, (courtesy of Mark Durkan and Eilis McDonald). This
      piece features interview with regular participants one year after
      their participation in ALIBI. Reliving the event and re-embodying
      their character, the participants process their experience and
      discuss the impact the evnt had on their ife.
